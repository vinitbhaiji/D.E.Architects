 It is my first freelance web development project. A fully functional and responsive dynamic website currently in work hosted on Hostinger Panel.

 This entire website is built on PHP and its framework Laravel. I have used authentication for safe login and logout of its admin panel. Through the admin panel, the owner can upload his blogs, projects, teams and much more.
